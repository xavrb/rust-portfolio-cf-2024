# Rust Portfolio Showcase

Welcome to my Rust portfolio showcase! This repository contains several small Rust programs that demonstrate my proficiency in the language. Feel free to explore each program below:

## Basics
- [Hello World](./basics/hello_world.rs) - A simple Hello World in Rust.


## More interesting ones

- [Program 1: Example Program](./program1.rs) - Description of what Program 1 does.
- [Program 2: Another Example Program](./program2.rs) - Description of what Program 2 does.
- [Program 3: Yet Another Example Program](./program3.rs) - Description of what Program 3 does.
- [Program 4: One More Example Program](./program4.rs) - Description of what Program 4 does.
- [Program 5: Final Example Program](./program5.rs) - Description of what Program 5 does.

## Getting Started

To run any of these programs locally, make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the program's file you want to run. Then, you can use the following command to compile and execute the program:

```bash
rustc program1.rs
./program1
