# Rust Portfolio Showcase

Welcome to my Rust portfolio showcase! This repository contains several small Rust programs that demonstrate my proficiency in the language. Feel free to explore each program below:

## Basics
- [Hello World](./basics/hello-world/hello_world.rs) - A simple Hello World in Rust.
- [Guessing Game](./basics/guessing-game/src/main.rs) - A game where the computer selects a random number and the user has to guess it.  
- [Calculator](./basics/calculator/src/main.rs) - A basic calculator program that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.  
- [FizzBuzz](./basics/fizzbuzz/src/main.rs) - A program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".  
- [Fibonacci Sequence](./basics/fibonacci/src/main.rs) - A program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms specified by the user.   
- [Prime Number Checker](./basics/is-prime/src/main.rs) - A program that checks whether a given number is prime or not.  
- [Temperature Converter](./basics/temperature-converter/src/main.rs) - A program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  
- [Factorial Calculator](./basics/factorial-calculator/src/main.rs) - A program that calculates the factorial of a given number.  
- [Palindrome Checker](./basics/is-palindrome/src/main.rs) - A program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.  
- [File Reader/Writer](./basics/file-reader-writer/src/main.rs) - A program that reads from a file, manipulates the data, and writes the results to another file.  

## More interesting ones

- [Program 1: Example Program](./program1.rs) - Description of what Program 1 does.
- [Program 2: Another Example Program](./program2.rs) - Description of what Program 2 does.
- [Program 3: Yet Another Example Program](./program3.rs) - Description of what Program 3 does.
- [Program 4: One More Example Program](./program4.rs) - Description of what Program 4 does.
- [Program 5: Final Example Program](./program5.rs) - Description of what Program 5 does.

## Getting Started

To run any of these programs locally, make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the program's file you want to run. Then, you can use the following command to compile and execute the program:

```bash
rustc program1.rs
./program1
